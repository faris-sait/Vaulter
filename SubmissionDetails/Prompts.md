**Tool Used : AI Vibe Coder Tool "emergent.sh"**

**LLM Model Used : Claude Sonnet 4.5**



**Main App Prompt:**

        Backend (Next.js API Routes)

        Authentication: Clerk JWT verification middleware

        Encryption: AES-256 encryption using the cryptography library

**API Endpoints:**

        POST /api/keys/ → Create encrypted API key

        GET /api/keys/ → List all keys (masked)

        GET /api/keys/{id} → Get decrypted key

        DELETE /api/keys/{id} → Delete key

        POST /api/usage/{id} → Log usage event

**Database:**

        Supabase integration with encrypted storage

**Security:**

       Keys are encrypted before database storage

       Never stored or transmitted in plaintext

**Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind CSS)**

**Authentication:**

       Clerk integration with protected routes

**UI Components:**

&nbsp;      Glassmorphic cards with backdrop blur


       Dashboard with stats (total keys, recently used, tags)

       “Add Key” modal with form validation

       Key cards with reveal/hide functionality

       Search and filter by tags

**Animations:**

       Framer Motion for smooth transitions

**Features:**

      Copy to clipboard

      Usage tracking

      Masked key display (e.g., sk-1234...abcd)

**Key Security Flow:**

    User enters API key in form (exists only in browser memory)

    Form submits to backend

    Backend immediately encrypts the key

    Only encrypted version is stored in database

    Frontend receives only masked version

    Full key revealed only when user clicks “Reveal” button

**Project Structure:**

      Clean separation of concerns

      Type-safe with TypeScript (frontend) and Next.js API Routes(backend)

      Environment variables for all sensitive configs

      Ready for deployment on Vercel.

**Summary :**

This implementation ensures that API keys are never stored in plaintext, while providing a secure, functional, and elegant glassmorphic UI for managing them efficiently.



**Further Improvements :**

 

&nbsp;  Add minimal but strong branding to an existing web app named “Vaulter”, which allows users to securely manage and download environment variables (API keys, etc.).

&nbsp;  

**Requirements:**

&nbsp;    No backend or API changes — only frontend modifications.

&nbsp;    Add the name “Vaulter” consistently in the UI:

&nbsp;    Top-left logo or title (e.g., “🔐 Vaulter” or a simple vault icon + text).

&nbsp;    Page titles, headers, or metadata (e.g., Vaulter | Secure .env Manager).

&nbsp;    Update button labels or tooltips if needed (e.g., “Save with Vaulter”).

&nbsp;    Keep it minimalistic and elegant, aligned with the existing design system (dark modern gradient, glassmorphism, Tailwind aesthetic).

&nbsp;    Include a subtle tagline under the title:

&nbsp;    “Your keys. Your vault. Your control.”

&nbsp;    If a landing or dashboard page exists, show a small “Vaulter” watermark or footer text.

&nbsp;    Ensure full responsiveness and accessibility remain intact.

&nbsp;    Keep the tone consistent secure, developer-focused, and clean — without changing any existing logic or backend routes.

**Prompt for logo Improvements:**

&nbsp;  

&nbsp;    Add the Vaulter logo next to the existing "Vaulter" branding text in the web app.



**Instructions:**



&nbsp;    Do NOT modify or affect any backend, Supabase, or API functionality.

&nbsp;    Only update the frontend where the "Vaulter" name is displayed (e.g., navbar, header, or app title).

&nbsp;    Import and display the logo image (transparent background) from:

&nbsp;    /public/assets/vaulter-logo.svg

&nbsp;    Place the logo to the left of the "Vaulter" text using flexbox, with a small gap (gap-2).

&nbsp;    Size the logo to 28x28px and ensure it is vertically centered.

&nbsp;    Add a smooth, continuous spin animation to the logo:

&nbsp;    Duration: 6 seconds

&nbsp;    Timing: linear

&nbsp;    Repeat: infinite

&nbsp;    Direction: normal

&nbsp;    The "Vaulter" text should keep its current styling and colors.

&nbsp;    Maintain full responsiveness — logo and text should stay aligned and centered on all screen sizes.
