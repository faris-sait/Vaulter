PROJECT GOAL
Vaulter wants to give developers a safe and easy-to-use platform to handle, protect, and keep track of API keys. The main idea is to reduce the dangers of keeping keys stored by hand, by using strong AES-256 encryption, secure JWT authentication, and a clean, modern glassmorphic dashboard, making everything both safe and efficient.
